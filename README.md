# An Entanglement-Aware Middleware for Digital Twins: Artifacts

This repository contains the artifacts described in the research paper titled "An Entanglement-Aware Middleware for Digital Twins."
This repository hosts any relevant artifacts that we used during our research. 
It serves to increase the reproducibility and understanding of our work.

This repository is structured as follows:
```
